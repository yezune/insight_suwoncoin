# uglifyify

A [Browserify](http://browserify.org) v2 transform which minifies your code
using [UglifyJS2](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS).

## Installation

``` bash
npm install uglifyify
```

## Motivation/Usage

Ordinarily you'd be fine doing this:

``` bash
browserify index.js | uglifyjs -c > bundle.js
```

But uglifyify gives you the benefit applying Uglify's "squeeze" transform
*before* it's processed by Browserify, meaning you can remove dead code paths
for conditional requires. Here's a contrived example:

``` javascript
if (true) {
  module.exports = require('./browser')
} else {
  module.exports = require('./node')
}
```

`module.exports = require('./node')` will be excluded by Uglify, meaning that
only `./browser` will be bundled and required.

If you combine uglifyify with [envify](http://github.com/hughsk/envify), you
can make this a little more accessible. Take this code:

``` javascript
if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development') {
  module.exports = require('./development')
} else {
  module.exports = require('./production')
}
```

And use this to compile:

``` bash
NODE_ENV=development browserify -t envify -t uglifyify index.js -o dev.js &&
NODE_ENV=production browserify -t envify -t uglifyify index.js -o prod.js
```

It should go without saying that you should be hesitant using environment
variables in a Browserify module - this is best suited to your own
applications or modules built with Browserify's `--standalone` tag.

## Global Transforms

You might also want to take advantage of uglifyify's pre-bundle minification
to produce slightly leaner files across your entire browserify bundle. By
default, transforms only alter your application code, but you can use global
transforms to minify module code too. From your terminal:

``` bash
browserify -g uglifyify ./index.js > bundle.js
```

Or programatically:

``` bash
var browserify = require('browserify')
var fs = require('fs')

var bundler = browserify(__dirname + '/index.js')

bundler.transform({
  global: true
}, 'uglifyify')

bundler.bundle()
  .pipe(fs.createWriteStream(__dirname + '/bundle.js'))
```

Not that this is fine for uglifyify as it shouldn't modify the behavior of
your code unexpectedly, but transforms such as envify should almost always
stay local â€“ otherwise you'll run into unexpected side-effects within modules
that weren't expecting to be modified as such.
